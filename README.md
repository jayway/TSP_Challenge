Jayways TSP challenge
==========

The goal is simple, claim the shortest path on as many of the graphs as possible. The graphs can be found in this repo in the /nodegen folder, and are named xxx_locations.csv where the xxx stands for how many nodes the graph contains.

There are a few java classes to help get you started:

Using those you get reading and writing files for free as well as drawing of you path to screen to see whats going on. Compile and run TSPSolver.java to get a first ideea of what a bad path can look like.

Claiming a sortest path is done by committing a cvs file to the repo with the path, and then updating the xsl document found here:

Happy coding!

Thank you Johan Nordenswan for writing the nodegen.py script and Albin Theander for setting up the github repo.
