Jayways TSP challenge
==========

The goal is simple, claim the shortest path on as many of the graphs as possible. The graphs can be found in this repo in the /graphs folder, and are named x_locations.csv where the x is the number of nodes that the graph contains.

There are a few java classes to help get you started in this folder:
https://github.com/jayway/TSP_Challenge/tree/master/Get_Started_With_TSP

If you compile and run Get_Started_With_TSP/src/TSPSolver.java you will get a first ideea of what a bad path can look like.

Claiming a sortest path is done updating the xsl document found here:

Happy coding!

Thank you Johan Nordenswan for writing the nodegen.py script and Albin Theander for setting up the github repo.
